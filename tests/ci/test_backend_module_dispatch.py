"""Per-backend overrides shadow the shared operators; without one, sharing wins.

REWRITTEN for the single-implementation layout. The previous version asserted
that `spmv_csr.__implementation_module__` was always
`...backends.<backend>.spmv_csr`, which held only while every backend carried a
full copy of every operator -- 240,752 lines of which 19 in 20 files were
byte-identical. The operators live once now, and a backend directory holds only
what genuinely diverges, so the assertions here are:

  * with no override, every backend resolves to the SHARED module;
  * all eight registered backends resolve (gcu and mlu used to raise);
  * an override, when one exists, does shadow the shared module.
